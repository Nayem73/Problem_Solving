Sure, I'd be happy to explain this code to you. This is a Java implementation of the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which is used to find the majority element in an array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The `majorityElement` function takes an integer array `num` as input.

2. It initializes two variables: `major` and `count`. `major` is set to the first element of the array, and `count` is set to 1. The variable `major` keeps track of the current candidate for the majority element, and `count` keeps track of the number of occurrences of the `major`.

3. The function then enters a loop that iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element:

   - If `count` is 0, it means the current `major` is not the majority. So, it sets `count` to 1 and changes `major` to the current element.
   
   - If the current element is the same as `major`, it increments `count` by 1.
   
   - If the current element is different from `major`, it decrements `count` by 1.

4. After the loop, `major` will be the majority element. This is because any element that is not the majority can pair up with a different element and 'cancel out', leaving the majority element as the remaining candidate.

5. Finally, the function returns `major` as the majority element.

This algorithm assumes that there is always a majority element in the array (an element that appears more than `n/2` times, where `n` is the size of the array). If there's a chance that there might not be a majority element, you would need to add a second pass over the array to confirm that the candidate is indeed the majority element.
