## AI Models

### Highly Accurate AI Models

- Our AI-Farming platform supports disease prediction for 5 plants:
```
├─banana
|   ├─early
|   ├─late
|   ├─val
├─env
├─banana-leaf-dataset
|   ├─train
|   ├─test
|   ├─val
|
```

- Each plant has its own dedicated AI model trained with millions of disease images, resulting in highly accurate predictions.
