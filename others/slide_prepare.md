I have a web based project that has an AI which can detect plant disease. This project is called AI-Farming. Here's how I am preparing presentation slides. please correct and beautify it:

slide 1: Our AI-Farming logo
lecture during slide 1: Assalamualaikum, I want to thank TherapBD for providing us with this opportunity to present our project AI-Farming. Today, we present you with a digital solution that not only can impact our country, but also on a global level. AI-Farming is a versatile web platform accessible on both mobile phones and PCs. It's your go-to solution for effortlessly detecting diseases in your plants. You need to take a picture of the affected leaves, select the plant type and upload to to our platform. When our Advanced AI detects any disease, you will get a detailed overview of the disease and a step by step solution with detailed medications.

slide 2: three images side by side (crop field, gardening on rooftop, gardening in balcony)
lecture during slide 2: Our solution is not just for a type of category of person, it’s for everyone - from full fledged farming, rooftop gardening and to hobbyist gardeners of balcony.

slide 3: slide with a plant disease picture
lecture during slide 3: And when you are in a situation like this, when you suspect your plant is affected by disease, our solution is right there for you.

slide 4: step by step disease detection slide picture side by side
lecture during slide 4: Just snap a picture of the affected leaves, select the plant type, and upload it to our platform and when our AI detects the disease, it will show you the disease with it’s details information.

slide 5: medication images
lecture during slide 5: You will find detailed medications and necessary steps to be taken here.

slide 6: It’s not just a model, it’s a working solution
lecture during slide 6: When we talk about Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence, we generally think of it as a theoretical model, but the project we are presenting here, is not just a model, it’s a full fledged working solution, able to impact the real world environment.

slide 7: slide showing a video demonstration of using AI to detect diseases
lecture during slide 7: we will demonstrate ourselves also

slide 8: five crops and twenty one diseases
lecture during slide 8: Our AI-Farming platform currently supports disease prediction for 5 plant species, encompassing 21 distinct diseases.

slide 9: Accuracy of our AI-model graph chart
lecture during slide 9: During the development phase, the five AI models achieved an accuracy rate of 99%.
In the current real-world deployment phase, these models exhibit an average accuracy of 98.5%.

slide 10: Accepted paper: Hemel Sharker Akash, Md Abdur Rahim, Abu Saleh Musa Miah, Yuichi Okuyama, Yoichi Tomioka and Jungpil Shin, “Generalized Technique for Potato Leaves Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Network,” in 8th International Conference on ICT for Sustainable Development, August 3rd -4th, 2023, Goa, India. [Accepted]
lecture during slide 10: We developed our project based on our Research,  
We have an accepted research paper for our AI-model in the 8th International Conference on ICT for Sustainable Development in Goa, India.

slide 11: Review share
lecture during slide 11: We also have a user community where users can review or share their experiences in the user community section.

slide 12: business model
lecture during slide 12: We could keep the platform up and running if we had enough donations. But to sustain the platform and in order to keep up with user demand and AI resource utilization, we need to have a working business model. So implemented a business model where userse will initially have a free quota of 20 AI-searches a month. For further usage, users can subscribe to our platform using the online payment gateway SSLCOMMERZ. This will help for our further research and to develop our platform.

slide 13: Technology Stack

slide 14: Kubernetes and Deployment
To improve the technical clarity of the passage, consider the following revised version:

"We have implemented a robust software architecture using Docker to isolate each microservice. To efficiently scale our platform's computational and user-handling capacity, we have leveraged Kubernetes. Kubernetes dynamically adjusts our platform's capacity as required. To ensure high availability, we have chosen Microsoft Azure as our cloud provider. Within Azure, we have deployed an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to create a highly fault-tolerant microservices architecture.

Additionally, we acquired the domain 'aifarming.tech' from the 'get.tech' domain provider. To establish secure communication with our users, we have employed Let's Encrypt TLS certificates. This comprehensive approach enhances the security of our platform and ensures its availability 24/7."
